The Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset which means there is more than one variable in the dataset, Ronald Fisher first created it in 1936, he was a Statistician from the UK. This dataset has data on Iris flowers, specifically the Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and the Iris virginica. The data is used to show the characteristics of length and width of sepals and of the petals. It was created to help with the identification of the three species of Iris in the dataset , which ,as will be shown, can be tricky.
This dataset is highly regarded and is used to help users understand concepts in data exploration, machine learning, and data visualization. It also helps to demonstrate a lot of concepts in data science. The user can analyse different areas of the dataset, such as data distribution, correlations between the different features, and to show when there is data that doesn't fit into the normal pattern, known as outliers.
