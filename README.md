# 4359-Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis
Coursework for ATU Data Analysis module

This repository contains two assessments; project.ipynb and tasks.ipynb.

The project is to look at the Iris dataset which is a multivariate dataset meaning there is more than one variable in the dataset, Ronald Fisher first created it in 1936, he was a Statistician from the UK. 

The second part of the coursework is a list of 5 tasks to be worked through. We look at a famous mathematical problem, the Collatz conjecture, followed by work on another dataset featuring Penguins. We also look at a prblem in probability using the flipping of two coins.
